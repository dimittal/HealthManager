					Diabetes Goals
				</h2>

				<p>People with diabetes or pre-diabetes are responsible for much of their care, which can be a daunting process. 
				However, self-care can be made easier by setting diabetes goals for blood sugar levels, weight loss, exercise and for control of other health risks.</p>

				<a href="#1">Diabetes Blood Sugar Goals</a><br>
				<a href="#2">Diabetes Weight Goals</a><br>
				<a href="#3">Diabetes Cardiac Goals</a><br>
				
				<h4><a name="1">Diabetes Blood Sugar Goals</a></h4>
				<p>The International Diabetes Center in Minneapolis, Minn., suggests setting blood sugar targets for people with prediabetes and diabetes, as measured in milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL). 
				The target ranges, summarized on the federal government's National Guideline Clearinghouse Web site, are as follows:</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li><b>Before a meal</b>: 70 mg/dL to 140 mg/dL</li>
					<li><b>Two hours after eating</b>: Less than 160 mg/dL</li>
					<li><b>At bedtime</b>: 100 mg/dL to 160 mg/dL</li>
					<li><b>Hemoglobin A1c level</b>: Less than 1% higher than the lab's normal glucose value</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>It also suggests that more than half of a person's self-administered blood sugar tests be within the targeted range and that he or she have no nighttime low blood sugars or any low blood sugars that require intervention.</p>
				<p>However, these general targets may need to be adapted specifically for individuals, says Sandra Krafsig, a registered nurse and certified diabetes educator at Marlborough Hospital in Massachusetts. 
				"The goals may vary depending on other risk factors, such as age, cardiac disease and other complications."</p>
				
				<h4><a name="2">Diabetes Weight Goals</a></h4>
				<p>Being overweight is itself a risk for diabetes. In addition, excess weight can make it harder for the body to use insulin. 
				Most healthcare professionals suggest that diabetics aim for a healthy weight for their height and body type. 
				This number is often based on a person's body mass index (between <b>18.5</b> and <b>24.9</b> is considered healthy), waist circumference (less than <b>40</b> inches for men; less than <b>35</b> for women) and frame.</p>
				
				<p>If a woman is pregnant, her healthcare provider may set guidelines for how much weight she should aim to gain during her pregnancy, depending on her prepregnancy weight and whether she has gestational diabetes. 
				These guidelines generally are:</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li>Three to six pounds for the first three months of pregnancy</li>
					<li>Between one half and one pound each week for the last six months of pregnancy</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h4><a name="3">Diabetes Cardiac Goals</a></h4>
				<p>The National Institutes of Health also sets target ranges for blood pressure and lipid levels, since each of those can contribute to the risk of heart disease:</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li><b>Blood pressure</b>: Less than 130/80</li>
					<li><b>Low-density lipoprotein (LDL or "bad" cholesterol)</b>: Less than 100 mg/dL</li>
					<li><b>High-density lipoprotein (HDL or "good" cholesterol)</b>: Greater than 40 mg/dL for men and greater than 50 for women</li>
					<li><b>Triglycerides</b>: Less than 150 mg/dL</li>
				</ul>
