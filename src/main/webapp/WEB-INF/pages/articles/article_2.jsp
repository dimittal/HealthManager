					Insulin and Glucose
				</h2>

				<h3>How insulin works?</h3>
				<p>Insulin is a hormone that comes from the gland situated behind and below the stomach (pancreas).</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>The pancreas secretes insulin into the bloodstream.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>The insulin circulates, enabling sugar to enter your cells.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Insulin lowers the amount of sugar in your bloodstream.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>As your blood sugar level drops, so does the secretion of insulin from your pancreas.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h3>The role of Glucose</h3>
				<p>Glucose — a sugar — is a main source of energy for the cells that make up muscles and other tissues.</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>Glucose comes from two major sources: food and your liver.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Sugar is absorbed into the bloodstream, where it enters cells with the help of insulin.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Your liver stores and makes glucose.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>When your glucose levels are low, such as when you haven't eaten in a while, the liver breaks down stored glycogen into glucose to keep your glucose level within a normal range.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>In type 2 diabetes, this process doesn't work well. Instead of moving into your cells, sugar builds up in your bloodstream. 
				As blood sugar levels increase, the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas produce more insulin, but eventually these cells become impaired and can't make enough insulin to meet the body's demands.</p>
				<p>In the much less common type 1 diabetes, the immune system destroys the beta cells, leaving the body with little to no insulin.</p>
