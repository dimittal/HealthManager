					Pre-Diabetes
				</h2>

				<p>When a health care provider suspects pre-diabetes, he or she performs a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) test or an oral glucose tolerance test (OGGT). 
				Both involve a blood glucose test in the morning before any meal, including liquids. 
				Blood glucose levels help health care providers determine if a patient has pre-diabetes. 
				A fasting blood glucose level between 100mg/dL (milligrams per deciliter) and 125 mg/dL is the accepted range for a diagnosis of pre-diabetes. 
				The normal fasting blood glucose level is 100mg/dL and the cutoff for diagnosis of diabetes is 126mg/dL or above. 
				A reading of 100mg/dL can be thought of as 0.1 g of sugar for every tenth of a liter of blood.</p>

				<p>The OGGT additionally requires a blood glucose test two hours after drinking a sugary drink, which a health care professional can provide. The two-hour blood glucose range for someone with pre-diabetes is between 140mg/dL and 199mg/dL.</p>
				<p>The ADA recommends that people be tested every three years if their blood glucose levels are normal. People who have pre-diabetes should be tested for diabetes every one to two years.</p>
				
				<h3>FPG Test ranges (in mg/dL)</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p><b>Normal</b>: less than 100</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><b>Pre-Diabetes</b>: between 100 and 126</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><b>Diabetes</b>: more than 126</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h3>OGGT ranges: 2-hour blood results after 75g glucose load (in mg/dL)</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p><b>Normal</b>: less than 140</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><b>Pre-Diabetes</b>: between 140 and 199</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><b>Diabetes</b>: more than 199</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h3>HgbA1c Test results (in %)</h3>
				<p>A person can fall into the pre-diabetes range by having an elevated Hemoglobin A1c (<a href="/HealthManager/education/articles/6/">HgbA1c</a>). 
				The HgbA1c is a three month average of the blood sugars. 
				Where the fasting glucose and glucose tolerance test give a snap shot of what the blood sugar is doing at a given time, the HgbA1c gives an average of 24 hours over the course of three months. </p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p><b>Normal</b>: less than 5.7</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><b>Pre-Diabetes</b>: between 5.7 and 6.4</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><b>Diabetes</b>: more than 6.4</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
