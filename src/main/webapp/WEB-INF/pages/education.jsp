					<p>Pre-Diabetes is a condition in which blood glucose levels are higher than normal but not high enough to be categorized as diabetes. People having such condition are at a high risk of developing <a href="/HealthManager/education/articles/1/">Type-2 Diabetes</a> in the future. <a href="http://www.diabetes.co.uk/news/2014/Jan/more-than-140-million-estimated-to-have-diabetes-or-prediabetes-in-india-96279767.html">View</a> the results of a study conducted by Indian Council of Medical Research.</p>

					<a name="2">What is Diabetes?</a>
					<p>Diabetes is a kind of disease in which blood glucose levels are above normal. Generally, human body converts most of the food we eat into glucose. Pancreas, an organ near the stomach, is responsible for making a hormone called Insulin, which helps glucose get into our body cells for synthesizing energy. In the condition of diabetes, the human body cannot make enough insulin or cannot use its own insulin to a great extent. This causes high levels of glucose than usual in our blood.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<a name="3">Can diabetes be dangerous?</a><br>
					<p>Controlled diabetes will not cause much problem to the body. Long un-controlled diabetes can cause various severe health complications by making organs such as heart, eyes and kidneys vulnerable unhealthy. It can also cause damage to joints and bones, causing restrictions and subsequent pain in arms and legs. </p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<a name="4">Is Diabetes curable?</a>
					<p>No, diabetes is not curable but is controllable to a large extent with the help of healthy lifestyle, regular monitoring and timely medication.</p>
